### Details ðŸ“’

The plugins creates a tarball compressing all the files included inside of `sources`.
Then the compressed tarball gets uploaded, extracted and deleted, leaving only the files specified by `sources` inside of the `target` folder.
Afterwards all the commands inside of `commands` will get executed at the `target` directory.
